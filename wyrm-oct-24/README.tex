\pagehead{README}
To the unfortunate souls who chose to work on this mess of a template, here's what you need to do:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Navigate to the \verb|txt| folder. You should find a .tex file named after your role. Type your stuff on there.
    \item Once that's done, pick an appropriate profile picture and head to the \verb|profile| folder under \verb|img|. Rename your picture with one of the png file names and replace it.
    \item Go to \verb|main.tex| and replace ``placeholder" with the appropriate tag in your section ie ``chair" or ``librarian"
\end{enumerate}

Note: If you face any issues, please harass the dumbass who got elected to be editor this year. Happy \LaTeX ing :)\
