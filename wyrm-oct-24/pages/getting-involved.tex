\subhead{Mailing Lists}

ICSF maintains the following mailing lists, to which all members are welcome to
subscribe:

\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{icsf-list}
is the society’s core mailing list, which communicates announcements
of ICSF events and important news about the society. This list does
not generate an overwhelming amount of traffic, and subscription is a
must if you would like to hear about film trips and other activities.

% \item \texttt{icsf-committee}
% is our ‘management’ list --- but it gets used a lot more
% widely than that. Here you’ll be able to contribute your opinion to
% the running of the society.
\end{itemize}
