Hi, this is Kai, head librarian of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Society for the upcoming academic year. Our sci-fi library is great -- located in Beit's West Basement, we have basically any fantasy or sci-fi series you'd want to read (our collection boasts just over 10000+ books), and if we don't, you can request it and we can have it added. You need membership to borrow books, but not if you are just reading in the library.

We are open 12-2 on weekdays with a pretty friendly atmosphere and a lot of comfy beanbags you can lounge on, though it's good to come just for the books :D. We also hold various events, sporadically with pizza. On some Fridays, we pick out something to watch from our wall of 3000 DVDs.
