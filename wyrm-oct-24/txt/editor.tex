Another year, another \textit{Wyrmtongue} newsletter! If you're new around these parts, fear not, this caffeine-addicted editor shall explain the nature of these digital pages laid before your eyes...

The \textit{Wyrmtongue} is the official publication brought to you by the nerds at Imperial's Science Fiction and Fantasy Society. This newsletter is one of three issues released each year under this title. The other two being a collection of short stories and artwork written and designed by our wonderful members (more on that later), and a magazine created for an inconspicuous gathering of \textbf{actual sci-fi authors} happening some time next term\footnotemark[2]{}. This issue contains society news, some book recommendations from our committee, and information about our upcoming sci-fi convention happening in Spring term.

For those more interested in creating something related to the genre, our annual \textit{Wyrmtongue} anthology features short stories, artwork and poetry produced by our members in conjunction with said convention. These will have to be related to this year's theme (announced in the \textbf{Picocon} section), and submissions will be open from the \textbf{start of Spring term}, but feel free to ruminate on your ideas in the meantime and message \texttt{icsfwyrmtongue@gmail.com} if you have any questions.

Read on to find out more about our society, committee, some future events and our library of books and movies in \textbf{Beit's West Basement}. Have a great year, and I hope to see you soon!
