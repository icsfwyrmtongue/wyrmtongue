Sentience. A contentious subject, for who can know the mind of the other? When does an entity stop being a simple automaton reacting to external stimuli with instinctive (or programmed) responses, and begin to truly feel? How would we know when it does? It has been a wonderful experience organising this convention, and I hope you enjoy it in turn. That is, if I really have the capacity to experience, and to hope, instead of secretly being a chatbot or something. Who knows?
