Sid's stuff.

% Continuing our traditional close relationship, Tabletop gaming will be running Femtocon!!! An all day Board games session with a selection of our \emph{very} expansive board game collection (almost 200 games !!!). If you wanna relax for a bit and play some boardgames, you will find us in the \emph{Blackett Foyer} all day long!

% We run weekly events for LARP, RPGs, Board games and MTG. so if you enjoy our session, or are interested in any of the other things we have to offer, please check out timings for our sessions on our union page or on our discord.
