Hello there.

For first-timers and returning guests alike, I hope you're having a wonderful time at this year's Picocon (it's been 40 years can you believe it) and I am very pleased to announce/shamelessly advertise the return of the Picocon fanzine! For those who are unaware, this is where a bunch of artwork and short stories and anything related to the year's theme gets compiled and published for y'all to enjoy. Once again, many thanks to those who sent us their work to make this possible :) 

This afternoon we'll be doing [stuff]. Also, be sure to check out our Twisted t-shirts designed by our fantastic chair-being and not-dictator Rebecca Allday.

That's all from me. Enjoy!
