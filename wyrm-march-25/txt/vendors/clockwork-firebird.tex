I am a self-taught, ever-evolving tailor, leather worker and costume
maker with a penchant for creating monsters. I attend Live Action
Role-Play (LARP) events and Anime/Comic conventions as both a trader
and attendee on a regular basis. I’ve been doing leather work since
2008, and selling since 2011. I recall learning to sew when I was 6
years old and I’ve not really stopped since. Within the shop you may
find armour, masks, trinkets, painted artworks, soft toys \ldots
anything I bring to mind or feel like turning my hand to! I am still
finding my feet, and I am always learning new techniques.
