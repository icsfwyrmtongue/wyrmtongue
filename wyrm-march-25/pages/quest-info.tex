% How could one prove to an alien that you were sentient?

Our robot overlords demand tribute, and only you lowly organics can provide. On the following pages is a list of artefacts that you must provide and bring to the most favoured underlings of The Future. (Committee members at the front desk) 

In return our magnanimous rulers will bestow upon you the glorious prize of continued existence, and points to measure the worth of it. 

Go to the front desk to be assigned to one of the three teams to compete in the scavenger hunt. 

% On the next two pages, you have all manner of things to collect. Some are alive, some are not and for others we dare not try to discern the difference. 

% Bring these things  to the front desk to increase your leaders' 
% The beasts of the menagerie grow hungry and bored... 

% On your way in, you should have been assigned to one of the following teams: \emph{Team Red}, \emph{Team Magic Horse}, or \emph{Team Cerberus}. If you have not been allocated a team (and want to be. Why wouldn't you though), then please go back to the desk you obtained this handbook from and kindly berate the receptionists until they give you one.

% On the next page, you will discover a list of potentially dangerous, maybe evil, and definitely surprising items. Find any of these things, bring evidence to the front desk and win fabulous prizes... such as points for your team (and uh...nothing else...)! Whoever earns the most points gets to go home proud knowing they managed to satisfy their glorious mascots (and not in their stomachs).

% Enjoy scavenging, and remember --- the menagerie does not like waiting...
